Facilities in this dataset include (but are not limited to) arenas, attractions, boat launches, cross-country ski trails, golf courses, funicular, outdoor ice rinks, outdoor pools, recreation centres, skateparks, and sports fields. Services in this dataset include (but are not limited to) ETS outages, LRT outages, bus service disruptions and delays, LRT bus replacement services and seasonal parking bans. \n\nAny discrepancies between this dataset and what is found at the inquiry tool, the inquiry tool shall be deemed the accurate record. Also, note that Facility Notifications themselves are updated manually and this this information should be considered in that context, and not a a \"real time\" reference.",
